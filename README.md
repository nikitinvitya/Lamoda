This is a single-page frontend application (SPA) that demonstrates complex client-side logic for filtering and sorting a list of products. The project is built with Vite, React, and JavaScript, and is visually inspired by the Lamoda interface. All data is static (mocked), with the primary focus on UI performance and responsiveness when manipulating a large catalog on the client side.
